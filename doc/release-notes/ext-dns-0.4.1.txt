This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  New stable release that includes fixings and official support for
  Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu LTS Precise.

  
Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Fixed clear host internal cache (it wasn't releasing memory).

* [fix] Fixed wrong return handling at ext_dnsd_send_reply inside
  ext-dnsd.

* [fix] Various compilation error spotted by gcc.

* [fix] Updated ext-dns package to be compilable at wheezy. Updated
  postinst to configure default ext-dns.conf if it doesn't exists.

* [fix] Added support to also resolve through /etc/hosts when forward
  all requests mode is enabled (no child resolver).

* [fix] Making ext-dns regression tests to work over the port 54.

* [fix] Fixed ext-dns client API to honour port configured and not
  used 53 as a fixed value.

* [fix] Updated ext-dnsd server to allow getting the running IP of the
  service to allow implementing script watching or other configuration
  checkings. Used this new setup to implement ext-dnsd-watcher cron
  now included in debian packages.

* [fix] Replaced all calls to strlen with ext_dns_strlen to better
  handle NULL values.

* [fix] Added additional checks to detect wrong data received by the
  API or from the network. Added additional regression test (test_24)
  to check support for crafted messages with broken records. No bug
  found. Nice.

* [fix] Fixed compilation warnings at server/main.c due to gcc
  complaining.

* [fix] Added support to ubuntu precise.
