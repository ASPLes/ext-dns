This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - EXT-DNSD: Improved ext-Dnsd server to restart childs in the case
     they die. Also added support to watch child status to kill them
     in the case they take too much time to finish. Added support to
     see current server state through /var/run/ext-dns.status. Fixed
     some problems while using the cache. Added support to queue
     pending requests that can't be handled because all childs are
     busy, but with a configurable limit, dropping the rest of the
     traffic.

 - LIB-EXTDNS: Several bugs and memory leaks were corrected. Added new
     API functions to ease adding records to query replies.
